File Format For Single Datasets Max Throughput
Note: I used the first interval as the overeall parameters to use
Meaning I interpolated over the whole dataset and used the over all parameters
The rest of the intervals are divided by throughput ranges
1. Min Throughput Percentage of Bandwidth, 2.Max Throughput Percentage of Bandwidth 3. CC_Level 4.PP_Level, P_Level is 1 don't need it, Min Confidence Interval, Max Condidence Interval
